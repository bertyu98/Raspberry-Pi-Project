# Raspberry-Pi-Project
This project developed is a Raspberry Pi based IoT device to implement an weather
Monitoring System. The data from this monitoring system will be used to decide on how much
water to be needed to irrigate and to “turn on” a virtual sprinkler system. 

Depending on the data retrieved from CIMIS and the local temperture/humidity, the amount of water transmitted will be determined.
A relay connected to and LCD will show when the irrigation is off, and a PIR sensor is also implemented to stop it when motion is detected.
